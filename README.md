I have built an Android-based application and that uses Java and XML. It is a "Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe Game" that consists of twelve(12)  Activities. 
I have increased the verification of users and imposed some restrictions. This app has a lot of functionalities like: 

It consists of 12 activities with different functions. The Functionality of all activities/pages are:-
  
1) This first page is a Splash Screen.
2) The Second page is Main Home Page that has 4 button for computer mode, with frind mode, setting, and Azure computer vision image button.
3) This Second page takes the choice of single or multiplayer layer

4) The 4th page takes single player input that is connected to Azure SQL Database. It takes Input as Player Name, age and Secret Code that stores in azure sql databse.
   This secret code is useful when player want to play 2nd time. When he/she enter only sectret code, all the data will fetch from database.
   
5) The 5th page takes Multiplayer inputs that is connected to Azure SQL Database. It has also same funtionality as Single player Input.

6) The 6th is for choosing element. Either cross or zero.
7) Finaly, 7th page is game page, where we can play game.

8) The 8th page is a setting page. It this page there are lot of functions like we can set complexity level of the game,  we can also share this game, 
   and give feedback and rate to this game.

9) The 9th page is for display screen for Azure Computer vision. It has button for enter into main page of computer vision page. 
10) And 10th, the last, page is for Azure computer vision.

Two more page for multiplayer element choice and ther input. 

Top services are used:-
-> Azure SQL Database
-> Azure Computer Vision
-> Google AdMob

*** Now coming to the Azure services, I have been using is the Azure SQL database. This service helps me to store players names, *ages, and Secret Code. This data is very useful to know, which age of user playing most. *And if the user age is below 15 years, then we can impose some restrictions. Apart from that if user using this app for the first time, then he/she have enter Name, age, and secret code. But after that he can use his secret code for further time. He need to just enter his secret code, then automatically it fetch data form azure database.
And the Second azure service that I am using, computer vision, that recognises the Popular celebrity  player from different sports. This service will help the players to know different celebrities related to sports.
for example : Popular Indian chess grandmaster and world chess champion, "Vishwanathan Anand"
